# Todo PERN Stack + Sequelize

This project was done as part of my practice of PostgreSQL + Sequelize, React.js, Express, Node.js. I also used as Git as VCS and GitHub to push the code and VSCode as editor.

Here you can find a TodoList in which you can add (POST) a todo, edit (PUT) a todo and deleted (DELETE) a todo and also get (GET) todos.

You can also go and check the [Client side here](https://github.com/ivanbatistao/todo-pern_stack_sequelize/tree/main/client) and the [Server side here](https://github.com/ivanbatistao/todo-pern_stack_sequelize/tree/main/server).

Thanks for taking the time to check this project.

All feedback is welcome!
